# What
This extension allows you to control MahjongSoul using keyboard shortcuts. You can select and play tiles using [ctrl + F], [ctrl + B], and [Enter].

Currently, only tile selection and play are supported, but in the future, you'll be able to choose calls.

Note: To function properly, you need to run this program on your PC: https://github.com/KantaHasegawa/mahjong-soul-keyboard-backend.
